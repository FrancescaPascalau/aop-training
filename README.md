This repo contains some AOP concepts used to create custom annotations.

# Some AOP Concepts:

- Join point: a point during the execution of a program, such as the execution of a method or the handling of an
  exception.
- Pointcut: a set of one or more JoinPoint where an advice should be executed. Pointcuts help narrow down the join points
  advised by an aspect.
